    3 - DONE!

Method #2 (bring up from files - hardest, but a snapshot, guaranteed to work correctly)
    1 - Create a new Google Drive Spreadsheet
    2 - Import and replace the spreadsheet with spreadsheet-contents.csv (resize columns/rows to your liking)
    3 - Create a new script ("Tools -> Script editor...")
